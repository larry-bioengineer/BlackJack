# BlackJack
A iOS game for playing blackjack with the computer

# Introduction
This is my first attempt to develop an iOS app myself. After learning how to develop a war card game through YouTube video, I decide I will try to develop a simple iOS app myself. But Blackjack is actually ridiculously complicated for a weekend project. Therefore, with limited time, my latest attempt is to develop a simple two cards black jack games. 

# Why am I building this?
This is me trying to learn new skills that is not really within the scope of work but could be complimentary to what I do. Knowing how an app is built lets me understand common problems mobile developers facing everyday. It allows me to set better work timelines with them. 

# Progress
I created the 1) UI, 2) CPU score counting, and 3) initializing new games.

2. Implement scoring system 
3. Implement splitting cards
